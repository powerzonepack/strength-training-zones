PZP Strength Zone Training: A Comprehensive System
--------------------------------------------------

Power Zone Pack (PZP) has achieved success in the Peloton and cycling community by using power zone training. There's a lack of a widely adopted, open standard for strength training zones. This system developed by PZP is designed to meet this need in strength training.

PZP developed this system to expand its offerings beyond cycling by creating PZP Strength Zone Training---a system that applies the principles of Power Zone Training to strength workouts. PZP designed this to provide a personalized, data-driven strength training experience that fosters community engagement and helps users achieve their fitness goals.

The Foundation: Functional Strength Threshold (FST)
---------------------------------------------------

At the core of PZP Strength Zone Training is the Functional Strength Threshold (FST), which represents the highest heart rate a user can sustain during a 20-30 minute high-intensity strength training session while maintaining proper form. Similar to Functional Threshold Power (FTP) in cycling, FST serves as the baseline for defining seven distinct strength training zones.

To determine a user's FST, the PZP app will guide them through a standardized assessment workout involving a combination of exercises like push-ups, squats, lunges, and rows, performed at maximum effort for a set time. The Apple Watch or similar device will monitor heart rate data throughout the test, allowing the PZP app to calculate the user's FST.

Alternatively, similar to Functional Threshold Power (FTP) in cycling, we might name this Functional Threshold Heart Rate (FTHR) that will serve as the baseline for strength training zones. FTHR represents the average heart rate a user can sustain during a high-intensity strength training session.

To determine FTHR, users will connect their heart rate monitor to the PZP app and perform a guided strength training session, similar to an FTP test. The app will analyze the collected heart rate data to calculate the user's FTHR.

The rest of this document describes the FST.

The Seven Strength Training Zones
---------------------------------

Based on the user's FST, the PZP app will establish seven personalized strength training zones:

Using FTHR as the anchor, the system will define seven strength training zones, mirroring PZP cycling zones:

| Zone | Name | % FST / FTHR | Description|
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
| 1 | Very Light| < 55% | Warm-up, cool-down, active recovery |
| 2 | Light | 55-65% | Light effort, focus on form and technique|
| 3 | Moderate | 66-75% | Building strength and endurance |
| 4 |  Tempo | 76-85% | Challenging but sustainable, building lactate threshold |
| 5 | Hard | 86-95% | High-intensity, building strength and power |
| 6 | Maximum | 96-105% | Short bursts of maximum effort, improving peak power |
| 7 | Neuromuscular | > 105% | Extremely short bursts, focusing on explosiveness and adaptation |
